### 👋 Jump In and Build with Us

This platform is just getting started, and there's still a lot to explore. Here’s where things currently stand:

- The landing page is live, but it could really use a better navigation bar. If you have ideas, feel free to jump in.
- The post creation interface isn’t fully working yet. A clean, functional “Post” button would be awesome.
- We haven’t finalized how the feed should look. There’s room to experiment. Show us what you think a social feed should feel like.
- Styling is still pretty raw in some places. If you enjoy clean UI or snappy animations, this is your playground.
- Backend logic is in its earliest stages. Any thoughts on database structure, real-time updates, or API routes are welcome.

Some of the current contributors have shared early designs and wireframes, but nothing is set in stone. Every commit helps define where this platform is heading.

If you’re into:
- Frontend UI or UX
- Backend logic
- Building cool open-source experiments
- Or just curious to get involved

Then this is a great time to step in.
